# pils
*pils* generates layout plans for interior placement. It is suitable for use at
runtime in all sorts of interactive applications, including games.

## Dependencies
* The dub build system
* GCC toolchain for polygon clipping dependency in C

## Usage
Link against pils or use the compagnion tool [lager](https://github.com/krachzack/lager) for interactive or non-interactive usage of *pils*.

## Licensing
Currently, *pils* is dual-licensed under the UNLICENSE and the custom license
of the [GPC](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~toby/gpc/#Licensing) clipping library.

While the source code  of *pils* as well as all examples and documentation are
dedicated to the public domain by releasing it unlicensed, it still depends on *GPC*, which has a custom license.

The conditions in UNLICENSE only apply unless otherwise noticed, as is the case
for the *GPC* dependency, which of course remains under its original license.
If you seek to use *pils* commercially, as of now, you have to work out
licensing with the university of manchester first, which is in charge of *GPC*.
