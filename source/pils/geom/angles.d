 + Calculates the angle between two lines both starting in middle. One line will
 + extend to start and one line will extend to end.
 +
 + The resulting angle indicates how much the first line needs to be
 + counter-clockwise rotated to have the same slope as the second line.
 + The returned angle is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to zero and
 + smaller than or equal to 2Ï€.
